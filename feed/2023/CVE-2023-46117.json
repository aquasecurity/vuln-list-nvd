A vulnerability has been identified in reconftw where inadequate validation of retrieved subdomains may lead to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious CSP entry on it's own domain. Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the application, potentially compromising the system. This issue has been addressed in version 2.7.1.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
