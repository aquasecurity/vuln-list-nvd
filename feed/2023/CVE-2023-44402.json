          "value": "Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This only impacts apps that have the `embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation` and `onlyLoadAppFromAsar` fuses enabled.  Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted.  This issue is specific to macOS as these fuses are only currently supported on macOS. Specifically this issue can only be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too.  i.e. the ability to edit files inside the `.app` bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against. There are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron."
