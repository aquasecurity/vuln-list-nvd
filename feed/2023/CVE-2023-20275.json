This vulnerability is due to improper validation of the packet's inner source IP address after decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets through the tunnel. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send a packet impersonating another VPN user's IP address. It is not possible for the attacker to receive return packets."
