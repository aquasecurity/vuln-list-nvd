The manipulation of the argument Site Title with the input \u003cscript\u003ealert(1)\u003c/script\u003e leads to cross site scripting. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The identifier VDB-244229 was assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way."
