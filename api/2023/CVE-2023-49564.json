      "value": "The CBIS/NCS Manager API is vulnerable to an authentication bypass. By sending a specially crafted HTTP header, an unauthenticated user can gain unauthorized access to API functions. This flaw allows attackers to reach restricted or sensitive endpoints of the HTTP API without providing any valid credentials. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in a weak verification mechanism within the authentication implementation present in the Nginx Podman container on the CBIS/NCS Manager host machine.\nThe risk can be partially mitigated by restricting access to the management network using external firewall."
