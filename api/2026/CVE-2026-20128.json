      "value": "A vulnerability in the Data Collection Agent (DCA) feature of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain DCA user privileges on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid\u0026nbsp;vmanage credentials on the affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the presence of a credential file for the DCA user on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the filesystem as a low-privileged user and reading the file that contains the DCA password from that affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access another affected system and gain DCA user privileges.\r\nNote: Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager releases 20.18 and later are not affected by this vulnerability."
