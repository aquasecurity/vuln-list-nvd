      "value": "ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. The shipped \"secure\" security policy includes a rule intended to prevent reading/writing from standard streams. However, ImageMagick also supports fd:\u003cn\u003e pseudo-filenames (e.g., fd:0, fd:1). Prior to versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40, this path form is not blocked by the secure policy templates, and therefore bypasses the protection goal of \"no stdin/stdout.\" Versions 7.1.2-15 and 6.9.13-40 contain a patch by including a change to the more secure policies by default. As a workaround, add the change to one's security policy manually."
