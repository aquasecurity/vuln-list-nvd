      "value": "Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.12.0-beta of the Audiobookshelf mobile application that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution through malicious library metadata. Attackers with library modification privileges (or control over a malicious podcast RSS feed) can execute code in victim users' WebViews, potentially leading to session hijacking, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to native device APIs. audiobookshelf-app version 0.12.0-beta fixes the issue."
