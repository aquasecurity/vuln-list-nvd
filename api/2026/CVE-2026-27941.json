      "value": "OpenLIT is an open source platform for AI engineering. Prior to version 1.37.1, several GitHub Actions workflows in OpenLIT's GitHub repository use the `pull_request_target` event while checking out and executing untrusted code from forked pull requests. These workflows run with the security context of the base repository, including a write-privileged `GITHUB_TOKEN` and numerous sensitive secrets (API keys, database/vector store tokens, and a Google Cloud service account key). Version 1.37.1 contains a fix."
