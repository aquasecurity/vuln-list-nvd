      "value": "OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. Prior to version 8.0.0, the session expiration check in `library/auth.inc.php` runs only when `skip_timeout_reset` is not present in the request. When `skip_timeout_reset=1` is sent, the entire block that calls `SessionTracker::isSessionExpired()` and forces logout on timeout is skipped. As a result, any request that includes this parameter (e.g. from auto-refresh pages like the Patient Flow Board) never runs the expiration check: expired sessions can continue to access data indefinitely, abandoned workstations stay active, and an attacker with a stolen session cookie can keep sending `skip_timeout_reset=1` to avoid being logged out. Version 8.0.0 fixes the issue."
