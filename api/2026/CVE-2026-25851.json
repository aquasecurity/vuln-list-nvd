An unauthenticated attacker can connect to the\n OCPP WebSocket endpoint using a known or discovered charging station \nidentifier, then issue or receive OCPP commands as a legitimate charger.\n Given that no authentication is required, this can lead to privilege \nescalation, unauthorized control of charging infrastructure, and \ncorruption of charging network data reported to the backend."
