      "value": "Phishing Club is a phishing simulation and man-in-the-middle framework. Prior to version 1.30.2, an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the GetOrphaned recipient listing endpoint in versions prior to v1.30.2. The endpoint constructs a raw SQL query and concatenates the user-controlled sortBy value directly into the ORDER BY clause without allowlist validation. Because unknown values are silently passed through `RemapOrderBy()`, an authenticated attacker can inject SQL expressions into the `ORDER BY` clause. This issue was patched in v1.30.2 by validating the order-by column against an allowlist and clearing unknown mappings."
