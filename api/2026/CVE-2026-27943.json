      "value": "OpenEMR is a free and open source electronic health records and medical practice management application. In versions up to and including 8.0.0, the eye exam (eye_mag) view loads data by `form_id` (or equivalent) without verifying that the form belongs to the current user’s patient/encounter context. An authenticated user can access or edit any patient’s eye exam by supplying another form ID; in some flows the session’s active patient may also be switched. A fix is available on the `main` branch of the OpenEMR GitHub repository."
