      "value": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper processing when parsing SNMP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by continuously sending SNMP queries\u0026nbsp;to a specific MIB of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a kernel panic on the device, resulting in a reload and a\u0026nbsp;DoS condition.\r\nNote: This vulnerability affects SNMP versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit\u0026nbsp;this vulnerability through SNMPv1 or\u0026nbsp;SNMPv2c, the attacker must have a valid read-only SNMP community string for the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMPv3, the attacker must have valid SNMP user credentials for the affected system."
