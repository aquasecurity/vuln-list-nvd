    {

      "value": "Since the encryption algorithm used to protect firmware updates is itself encrypted using key material available to an attacker (or anyone paying attention), the firmware updates may be altered by an unauthorized user, and then trusted by a Unitree product, such as the Unitree Go2 and other models. This issue appears to affect all of Unitree’s current offerings as of February 26, 2026, and so should be considered a vulnerability in both the firmware generation and extraction processes. At the time of this release, there is no publicly-documented mechanism to subvert the update process and insert poisoned firmware packages without the equipment owner’s knowledge."
