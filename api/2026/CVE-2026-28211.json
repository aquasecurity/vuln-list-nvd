      "value": "The NVDA Dev \u0026 Test Toolbox is an NVDA add-on for gathering tools to help NVDA development and testing. A vulnerability exists in versions 2.0 through 8.0 in the Log Reader feature of this add-on. A maliciously crafted log file can lead to arbitrary code execution when a user reads it with log reader commands. The log reading command process speech log entries in an unsafe manner. Python expressions embedded in the log may be evaluated when when speech entries are read with log reading commands. An attacker can exploit this by convincing a user to open a malicious crafted log file and to analyze it using the log reading commands. When the log is read, attacker-controlled code may execute with the privileges of the current user.\nThis issue does not require elevated privileges and relies solely on user interaction (opening the log file). Version 9.0 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, avoid using log reading commands, or at least, commands to move to next/previous log message (any message or commands for each type of message). For more security, one may disable their gestures in the input gesture dialog."
