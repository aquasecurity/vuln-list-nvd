An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the API of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with the privileges of the netadmin role.\r\nNote: Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager releases 20.18 and later are not affected by this vulnerability.\u0026nbsp;"
