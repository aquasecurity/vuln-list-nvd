      "value": "bleon-ethical/api-gateway-deploy provides API gateway deployment. Version 1.0.0 is vulnerable to an attack chain involving OS Command Injection and Privilege Escalation. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges within the container, potentially leading to a container escape and unauthorized infrastructure modifications. This is fixed in version 1.0.1 by implementing strict input sanitization and secure delimiters in entrypoint.sh, enforcing a non-root user (appuser) in the Dockerfile, and establishing mandatory security quality gates."
