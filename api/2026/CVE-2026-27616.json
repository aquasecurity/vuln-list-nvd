      "value": "Vikunja is an open-source self-hosted task management platform. Prior to version 2.0.0, the application allows users to upload SVG files as task attachments. SVG is an XML-based format that supports JavaScript execution through elements such as \u003cscript\u003e tags or event handlers like onload. The application does not sanitize SVG content before storing it. When the uploaded SVG file is accessed via its direct URL, it is rendered inline in the browser under the application's origin. As a result, embedded JavaScript executes in the context of the authenticated user. Because the authentication token is stored in localStorage, it is accessible via JavaScript and can be retrieved by a malicious payload. Version 2.0.0 patches this issue."
