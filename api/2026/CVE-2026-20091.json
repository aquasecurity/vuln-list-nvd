An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious data into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability,\u0026nbsp;the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with the role of Administrator or AAA Administrator.\u0026nbsp;"
