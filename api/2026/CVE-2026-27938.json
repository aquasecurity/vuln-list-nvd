      "value": "WPGraphQL provides a GraphQL API for WordPress sites. Prior to version 2.9.1, the `wp-graphql/wp-graphql` repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow (`release.yml`) vulnerable to OS command injection through direct use of `${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}` inside a `run:` shell block. When a pull request from `develop` to `master` is merged, the PR body is injected verbatim into a shell command, allowing arbitrary command execution on the Actions runner. Version 2.9.1 contains a fix for the vulnerability."
