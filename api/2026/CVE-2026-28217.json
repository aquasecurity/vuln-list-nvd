      "value": "hoppscotch is an open source API development ecosystem. Prior to version 2026.2.0, the `userCollection` GraphQL query accepts an arbitrary collection ID and returns the full collection data — including title, type, and the serialized `data` field containing HTTP requests with headers and potentially secrets — to any authenticated user, without verifying that the requesting user owns the collection. This is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) caused by a missing authorization check that exists on every other operation in the same resolver. Version 2026.2.0 fixes the issue."
