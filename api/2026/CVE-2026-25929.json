Prior to version 8.0.0, the document controller’s `patient_picture` context serves the patient’s photo by document ID or patient ID without verifying that the current user is authorized to access that patient. An authenticated user with document ACL can supply another patient’s ID and retrieve their photo. Version 8.0.0 fixes the issue."
