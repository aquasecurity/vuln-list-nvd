To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials and any role that includes CLI access.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing crafted commands at the CLI prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition."
