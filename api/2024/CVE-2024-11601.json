This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_options() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note this is limited to option values that can be saved as arrays."
