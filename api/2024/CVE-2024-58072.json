      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: rtlwifi: remove unused check_buddy_priv\n\nCommit 2461c7d60f9f (\"rtlwifi: Update header file\") introduced a global\nlist of private data structures.\n\nLater on, commit 26634c4b1868 (\"rtlwifi Modify existing bits to match\nvendor version 2013.02.07\") started adding the private data to that list at\nprobe time and added a hook, check_buddy_priv to find the private data from\na similar device.\n\nHowever, that function was never used.\n\nBesides, though there is a lock for that list, it is never used. And when\nthe probe fails, the private data is never removed from the list. This\nwould cause a second probe to access freed memory.\n\nRemove the unused hook, structures and members, which will prevent the\npotential race condition on the list and its corruption during a second\nprobe when probe fails."
