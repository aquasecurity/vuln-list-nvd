Only when all the preconditions mentioned below are fulfilled could a malicious actor associate a targeted local user account with a federated IDP user account that they control.\n\nThe Deployment should have: \n-An IDP configured for federated authentication with Silent JIT provisioning enabled.\n\nThe malicious actor should have:\n-A fresh valid user account in the federated IDP that has not been used earlier.\n-Knowledge of the username of a valid user in the local IDP. \n-An account at the federated IDP matching the targeted local username."
