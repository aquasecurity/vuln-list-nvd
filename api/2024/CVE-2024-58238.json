      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nBluetooth: btnxpuart: Resolve TX timeout error in power save stress test\n\nThis fixes the tx timeout issue seen while running a stress test on\nbtnxpuart for couple of hours, such that the interval between two HCI\ncommands coincide with the power save timeout value of 2 seconds.\n\nTest procedure using bash script:\n\u003cload btnxpuart.ko\u003e\nhciconfig hci0 up\n//Enable Power Save feature\nhcitool -i hci0 cmd 3f 23 02 00 00\nwhile (true)\ndo\n    hciconfig hci0 leadv\n    sleep 2\n    hciconfig hci0 noleadv\n    sleep 2\ndone\n\nError log, after adding few more debug prints:\nBluetooth: btnxpuart_queue_skb(): 01 0A 20 01 00\nBluetooth: hci0: Set UART break: on, status=0\nBluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_wakeup() tx_work scheduled\nBluetooth: hci0: btnxpuart_tx_work() dequeue: 01 0A 20 01 00\nCan't set advertise mode on hci0: Connection timed out (110)\nBluetooth: hci0: command 0x200a tx timeout\n\nWhen the power save mechanism turns on UART break, and btnxpuart_tx_work()\nis scheduled simultaneously, psdata-\u003eps_state is read as PS_STATE_AWAKE,\nwhich prevents the psdata-\u003ework from being scheduled, which is responsible\nto turn OFF UART break.\n\nThis issue is fixed by adding a ps_lock mutex around UART break on/off as\nwell as around ps_state read/write.\nbtnxpuart_tx_wakeup() will now read updated ps_state value. If ps_state is\nPS_STATE_SLEEP, it will first schedule psdata-\u003ework, and then it will\nreschedule itself once UART break has been turned off and ps_state is\nPS_STATE_AWAKE.\n\nTested above script for 50,000 iterations and TX timeout error was not\nobserved anymore."
