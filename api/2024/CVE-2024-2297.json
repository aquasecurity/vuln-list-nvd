      "value": "The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.6.1. This is due to insufficient validation checks placed on the create_autosave AJAX function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP code with elevated (administrator-level) privileges. NOTE: Successful exploitation requires (1) the Bricks Builder to be enabled for posts (2) Builder access to be enabled for contributor-level users, and (3) \"Code Execution\" to be enabled for administrator-level users within the theme's settings."
