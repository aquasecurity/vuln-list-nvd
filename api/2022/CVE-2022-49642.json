      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac: dwc-qos: Disable split header for Tegra194\n\nThere is a long-standing issue with the Synopsys DWC Ethernet driver\nfor Tegra194 where random system crashes have been observed [0]. The\nproblem occurs when the split header feature is enabled in the stmmac\ndriver. In the bad case, a larger than expected buffer length is\nreceived and causes the calculation of the total buffer length to\noverflow. This results in a very large buffer length that causes the\nkernel to crash. Why this larger buffer length is received is not clear,\nhowever, the feedback from the NVIDIA design team is that the split\nheader feature is not supported for Tegra194. Therefore, disable split\nheader support for Tegra194 to prevent these random crashes from\noccurring.\n\n[0] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-tegra/b0b17697-f23e-8fa5-3757-604a86f3a095@nvidia.com/"
