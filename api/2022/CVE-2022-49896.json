      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncxl/pmem: Fix cxl_pmem_region and cxl_memdev leak\n\nWhen a cxl_nvdimm object goes through a -\u003eremove() event (device\nphysically removed, nvdimm-bridge disabled, or nvdimm device disabled),\nthen any associated regions must also be disabled. As highlighted by the\ncxl-create-region.sh test [1], a single device may host multiple\nregions, but the driver was only tracking one region at a time. This\nleads to a situation where only the last enabled region per nvdimm\ndevice is cleaned up properly. Other regions are leaked, and this also\ncauses cxl_memdev reference leaks.\n\nFix the tracking by allowing cxl_nvdimm objects to track multiple region\nassociations."
