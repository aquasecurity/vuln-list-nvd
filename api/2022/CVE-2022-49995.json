      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwriteback: avoid use-after-free after removing device\n\nWhen a disk is removed, bdi_unregister gets called to stop further\nwriteback and wait for associated delayed work to complete.  However,\nwb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation dwork after\nthis has completed, which can result in the timer attempting to access the\njust freed bdi_writeback.\n\nFix this by checking if the bdi_writeback is alive, similar to when\nscheduling writeback work.\n\nSince this requires wb-\u003ework_lock, and wb_inode_writeback_end() may get\ncalled from interrupt, switch wb-\u003ework_lock to an irqsafe lock."
