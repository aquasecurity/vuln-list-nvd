      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrtw89: ser: fix CAM leaks occurring in L2 reset\n\nThe CAM, meaning address CAM and bssid CAM here, will get leaks during\nSER (system error recover) L2 reset process and ieee80211_restart_hw()\nwhich is called by L2 reset process eventually.\n\nThe normal flow would be like\n-\u003e add interface (acquire 1)\n-\u003e enter ips (release 1)\n-\u003e leave ips (acquire 1)\n-\u003e connection (occupy 1) \u003c(A) 1 leak after L2 reset if non-sec connection\u003e\n\nThe ieee80211_restart_hw() flow (under connection)\n-\u003e ieee80211 reconfig\n-\u003e add interface (acquire 1)\n-\u003e leave ips (acquire 1)\n-\u003e connection (occupy (A) + 2) \u003c(B) 1 more leak\u003e\n\nOriginally, CAM is released before HW restart only if connection is under\nsecurity. Now, release CAM whatever connection it is to fix leak in (A).\nOTOH, check if CAM is already valid to avoid acquiring multiple times to\nfix (B).\n\nBesides, if AP mode, release address CAM of all stations before HW restart."
