      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: hda: Fix page fault in snd_hda_codec_shutdown()\n\nIf early probe of HDAudio bus driver fails e.g.: due to missing\nfirmware file, snd_hda_codec_shutdown() ends in manipulating\nuninitialized codec-\u003epcm_list_head causing page fault.\n\nIinitialization of HDAudio codec in ASoC is split in two:\n- snd_hda_codec_device_init()\n- snd_hda_codec_device_new()\n\nsnd_hda_codec_device_init() is called during probe_codecs() by HDAudio\nbus driver while snd_hda_codec_device_new() is called by\ncodec-component's -\u003eprobe(). The second call will not happen until all\ncomponents required by related sound card are present within the ASoC\nframework. With firmware failing to load during the PCI's deferred\ninitialization i.e.: probe_work(), no platform components are ever\nregistered. HDAudio codec enumeration is done at that point though, so\nthe codec components became registered to ASoC framework, calling\nsnd_hda_codec_device_init() in the process.\n\nNow, during platform reboot snd_hda_codec_shutdown() is called for every\ncodec found on the HDAudio bus causing oops if any of them has not\ncompleted both of their initialization steps. Relocating field\ninitialization fixes the issue."
