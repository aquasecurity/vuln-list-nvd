      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nparisc: Fix non-access data TLB cache flush faults\n\nWhen a page is not present, we get non-access data TLB faults from\nthe fdc and fic instructions in flush_user_dcache_range_asm and\nflush_user_icache_range_asm. When these occur, the cache line is\nnot invalidated and potentially we get memory corruption. The\nproblem was hidden by the nullification of the flush instructions.\n\nThese faults also affect performance. With pa8800/pa8900 processors,\nthere will be 32 faults per 4 KB page since the cache line is 128\nbytes.  There will be more faults with earlier processors.\n\nThe problem is fixed by using flush_cache_pages(). It does the flush\nusing a tmp alias mapping.\n\nThe flush_cache_pages() call in flush_cache_range() flushed too\nlarge a range.\n\nV2: Remove unnecessary preempt_disable() and preempt_enable() calls."
