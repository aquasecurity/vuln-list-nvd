Unfortunately on s390 it uncovers old\ngcc bug which is fixed only since gcc-9.1 [gcc commit 3ad7fed1cc87\n(\"S/390: Fix PR89775. Stackpointer save/restore instructions removed\")]\nand backported to gcc-8.4 and later. Due to this bug gcc versions prior\nto 8.4 generate broken code which leads to stack corruptions.\n\nCurrent minimal gcc version required to build the kernel is declared\nas 5.1. It is not possible to fix all old gcc versions, so work\naround this problem by avoiding using global register variable for\ncurrent_stack_pointer."
