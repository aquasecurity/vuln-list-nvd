      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: Fix linkwatch use-after-free on disconnect\n\nusbnet uses the work usbnet_deferred_kevent() to perform tasks which may\nsleep.  On disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in\n-\u003endo_stop().  But in 2003, that was moved to -\u003edisconnect() by historic\ncommit \"[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock\":\n\n  https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c\n\nThe change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue\nimplementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait\nfor completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that\ncould deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex\nheld in -\u003endo_stop().\n\nThe commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a\nuse-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,\nax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:\n\n* If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before\n  disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)\n  -\u003estatus() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().\n* usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's -\u003elink_reset() callback,\n  which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().\n* That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().\n\nBecause usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),\nnetif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and\nlinkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.\n\nIn 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of\nusbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf\n(\"drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()\").\n\nUnfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to\n-\u003endo_stop().  Rectify that omission at long last."
