      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/fb-helper: Fix out-of-bounds access\n\nClip memory range to screen-buffer size to avoid out-of-bounds access\nin fbdev deferred I/O's damage handling.\n\nFbdev's deferred I/O can only track pages. From the range of pages, the\ndamage handler computes the clipping rectangle for the display update.\nIf the fbdev screen buffer ends near the beginning of a page, that page\ncould contain more scanlines. The damage handler would then track these\nnon-existing scanlines as dirty and provoke an out-of-bounds access\nduring the screen update. Hence, clip the maximum memory range to the\nsize of the screen buffer.\n\nWhile at it, rename the variables min/max to min_off/max_off in\ndrm_fb_helper_deferred_io(). This avoids confusion with the macros of\nthe same name."
