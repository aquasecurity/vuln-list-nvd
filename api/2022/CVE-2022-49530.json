      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/pm: fix double free in si_parse_power_table()\n\nIn function si_parse_power_table(), array adev-\u003epm.dpm.ps and its member\nis allocated. If the allocation of each member fails, the array itself\nis freed and returned with an error code. However, the array is later\nfreed again in si_dpm_fini() function which is called when the function\nreturns an error.\n\nThis leads to potential double free of the array adev-\u003epm.dpm.ps, as\nwell as leak of its array members, since the members are not freed in\nthe allocation function and the array is not nulled when freed.\nIn addition adev-\u003epm.dpm.num_ps, which keeps track of the allocated\narray member, is not updated until the member allocation is\nsuccessfully finished, this could also lead to either use after free,\nor uninitialized variable access in si_dpm_fini().\n\nFix this by postponing the free of the array until si_dpm_fini() and\nincrement adev-\u003epm.dpm.num_ps everytime the array member is allocated."
