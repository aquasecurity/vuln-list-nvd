      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: do not allow CHAIN_ID to refer to another table\n\nWhen doing lookups for chains on the same batch by using its ID, a chain\nfrom a different table can be used. If a rule is added to a table but\nrefers to a chain in a different table, it will be linked to the chain in\ntable2, but would have expressions referring to objects in table1.\n\nThen, when table1 is removed, the rule will not be removed as its linked to\na chain in table2. When expressions in the rule are processed or removed,\nthat will lead to a use-after-free.\n\nWhen looking for chains by ID, use the table that was used for the lookup\nby name, and only return chains belonging to that same table."
