      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusbnet: Run unregister_netdev() before unbind() again\n\nCommit 2c9d6c2b871d (\"usbnet: run unbind() before unregister_netdev()\")\nsought to fix a use-after-free on disconnect of USB Ethernet adapters.\n\nIt turns out that a different fix is necessary to address the issue:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/18b3541e5372bc9b9fc733d422f4e698c089077c.1650177997.git.lukas@wunner.de/\n\nSo the commit was not necessary.\n\nThe commit made binding and unbinding of USB Ethernet asymmetrical:\nBefore, usbnet_probe() first invoked the -\u003ebind() callback and then\nregister_netdev().  usbnet_disconnect() mirrored that by first invoking\nunregister_netdev() and then -\u003eunbind().\n\nSince the commit, the order in usbnet_disconnect() is reversed and no\nlonger mirrors usbnet_probe().\n\nOne consequence is that a PHY disconnected (and stopped) in -\u003eunbind()\nis afterwards stopped once more by unregister_netdev() as it closes the\nnetdev before unregistering.  That necessitates a contortion in -\u003estop()\nbecause the PHY may only be stopped if it hasn't already been\ndisconnected.\n\nReverting the commit allows making the call to phy_stop() unconditional\nin -\u003estop()."
