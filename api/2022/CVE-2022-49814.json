      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkcm: close race conditions on sk_receive_queue\n\nsk-\u003esk_receive_queue is protected by skb queue lock, but for KCM\nsockets its RX path takes mux-\u003erx_lock to protect more than just\nskb queue. However, kcm_recvmsg() still only grabs the skb queue\nlock, so race conditions still exist.\n\nWe can teach kcm_recvmsg() to grab mux-\u003erx_lock too but this would\nintroduce a potential performance regression as struct kcm_mux can\nbe shared by multiple KCM sockets.\n\nSo we have to enforce skb queue lock in requeue_rx_msgs() and handle\nskb peek case carefully in kcm_wait_data(). Fortunately,\nskb_recv_datagram() already handles it nicely and is widely used by\nother sockets, we can just switch to skb_recv_datagram() after\ngetting rid of the unnecessary sock lock in kcm_recvmsg() and\nkcm_splice_read(). Side note: SOCK_DONE is not used by KCM sockets,\nso it is safe to get rid of this check too.\n\nI ran the original syzbot reproducer for 30 min without seeing any\nissue."
