If, for example, a trusted CA certificate\nshould be trusted only for the purpose of authenticating TLS servers but not\nfor CMS signature verification and the CMS signature verification is intended\nto be marked as rejected with the -addreject option, the resulting CA\ncertificate will be trusted for CMS signature verification purpose instead.\n\nOnly users which use the trusted certificate format who use the openssl x509\ncommand line application to add rejected uses are affected by this issue.\nThe issues affecting only the command line application are considered to\nbe Low severity.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue.\n\nOpenSSL 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0, 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are also not affected by this\nissue."
