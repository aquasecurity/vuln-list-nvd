      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (path traversal). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted web request to an affected device, followed by a specific command through an SSH session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of an affected device as a low-privilege user. A successful exploit could also allow the attacker to undertake further actions to elevate their privileges to root."
