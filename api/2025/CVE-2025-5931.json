      "value": "The Dokan Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 4.0.5. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password during a staff password reset. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with vendor-level access and above, to elevate their privilege to the level of a staff member and then change arbitrary user passwords, including those of administrators in order to gain access to their accounts. By default, the plugin allows customers to become vendors."
