      "value": "A vulnerability in the IKEv2 feature of Cisco IOS Software, IOS XE Software, Secure Firewall ASA Software, and Secure FTD Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the improper processing of IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an infinite loop that exhausts resources and could cause the device to reload."
