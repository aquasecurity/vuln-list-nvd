      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npds_core: Prevent possible adminq overflow/stuck condition\n\nThe pds_core's adminq is protected by the adminq_lock, which prevents\nmore than 1 command to be posted onto it at any one time. This makes it\nso the client drivers cannot simultaneously post adminq commands.\nHowever, the completions happen in a different context, which means\nmultiple adminq commands can be posted sequentially and all waiting\non completion.\n\nOn the FW side, the backing adminq request queue is only 16 entries\nlong and the retry mechanism and/or overflow/stuck prevention is\nlacking. This can cause the adminq to get stuck, so commands are no\nlonger processed and completions are no longer sent by the FW.\n\nAs an initial fix, prevent more than 16 outstanding adminq commands so\nthere's no way to cause the adminq from getting stuck. This works\nbecause the backing adminq request queue will never have more than 16\npending adminq commands, so it will never overflow. This is done by\nreducing the adminq depth to 16."
