      "value": "A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator for a limited set of functions on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side validation of user-supplied parameters in API or HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted API or HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access, modify, or delete data beyond the sphere of their intended access level, including obtaining potentially sensitive information stored in the system."
