      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu: Fix potential memory leak in iopf_queue_remove_device()\n\nThe iopf_queue_remove_device() helper removes a device from the per-iommu\niopf queue when PRI is disabled on the device. It responds to all\noutstanding iopf's with an IOMMU_PAGE_RESP_INVALID code and detaches the\ndevice from the queue.\n\nHowever, it fails to release the group structure that represents a group\nof iopf's awaiting for a response after responding to the hardware. This\ncan cause a memory leak if iopf_queue_remove_device() is called with\npending iopf's.\n\nFix it by calling iopf_free_group() after the iopf group is responded."
