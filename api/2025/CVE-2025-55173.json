In versions before 14.2.31 and from 15.0.0 to before 15.4.5, Next.js Image Optimization is vulnerable to content injection. The issue allowed attacker-controlled external image sources to trigger file downloads with arbitrary content and filenames under specific configurations. This behavior could be abused for phishing or malicious file delivery. This vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js versions 14.2.31 and 15.4.5."
