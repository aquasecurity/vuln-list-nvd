      "value": "Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Commons VFS before 2.10.0.\n\nThe FileObject API in Commons VFS has a 'resolveFile' method that\ntakes a 'scope' parameter. Specifying 'NameScope.DESCENDENT' promises that \"an exception is thrown if the resolved file is not a descendent of\nthe base file\". However, when the path contains encoded \"..\"\ncharacters (for example, \"%2E%2E/bar.txt\"), it might return file objects that are not\na descendent of the base file, without throwing an exception.\nThis issue affects Apache Commons VFS: before 2.10.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.10.0, which fixes the issue."
