      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrseq: Fix segfault on registration when rseq_cs is non-zero\n\nThe rseq_cs field is documented as being set to 0 by user-space prior to\nregistration, however this is not currently enforced by the kernel. This\ncan result in a segfault on return to user-space if the value stored in\nthe rseq_cs field doesn't point to a valid struct rseq_cs.\n\nThe correct solution to this would be to fail the rseq registration when\nthe rseq_cs field is non-zero. However, some older versions of glibc\nwill reuse the rseq area of previous threads without clearing the\nrseq_cs field and will also terminate the process if the rseq\nregistration fails in a secondary thread. This wasn't caught in testing\nbecause in this case the leftover rseq_cs does point to a valid struct\nrseq_cs.\n\nWhat we can do is clear the rseq_cs field on registration when it's\nnon-zero which will prevent segfaults on registration and won't break\nthe glibc versions that reuse rseq areas on thread creation."
