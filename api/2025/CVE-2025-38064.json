      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvirtio: break and reset virtio devices on device_shutdown()\n\nHongyu reported a hang on kexec in a VM. QEMU reported invalid memory\naccesses during the hang.\n\n\tInvalid read at addr 0x102877002, size 2, region '(null)', reason: rejected\n\tInvalid write at addr 0x102877A44, size 2, region '(null)', reason: rejected\n\t...\n\nIt was traced down to virtio-console. Kexec works fine if virtio-console\nis not in use.\n\nThe issue is that virtio-console continues to write to the MMIO even after\nunderlying virtio-pci device is reset.\n\nAdditionally, Eric noticed that IOMMUs are reset before devices, if\ndevices are not reset on shutdown they continue to poke at guest memory\nand get errors from the IOMMU. Some devices get wedged then.\n\nThe problem can be solved by breaking all virtio devices on virtio\nbus shutdown, then resetting them."
