The sequence\nof operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                    CPU1\n\n                        | ssip_xmit_work\nssi_protocol_remove     |\nkfree(ssi);             |\n                        | struct hsi_client *cl = ssi-\u003ecl;\n                        | // use ssi\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding\nwith the cleanup in ssi_protocol_remove()."
