      "value": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MainWP MainWP Dashboard v5.3.4 exists in class/class-mainwp-post-handler.php, where unsanitized user input from $_POST['sites'], $_POST['clients'], and $_POST['search'] is passed into the MainWP_User::render_table function. Despite using sanitize_text_field and wp_unslash, the values are not adequately protected against HTML or script injection. This flaw could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
