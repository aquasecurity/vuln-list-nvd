      "value": "golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Prior to \n5.2.2 and 4.5.2, the function parse.ParseUnverified splits (via a call to strings.Split) its argument (which is untrusted data) on periods. As a result, in the face of a malicious request whose Authorization header consists of Bearer  followed by many period characters, a call to that function incurs allocations to the tune of O(n) bytes (where n stands for the length of the function's argument), with a constant factor of about 16. This issue is fixed in 5.2.2 and 4.5.2."
