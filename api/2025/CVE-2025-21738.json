      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nata: libata-sff: Ensure that we cannot write outside the allocated buffer\n\nreveliofuzzing reported that a SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl with out_len\nset to 0xd42, SCSI command set to ATA_16 PASS-THROUGH, ATA command set to\nATA_NOP, and protocol set to ATA_PROT_PIO, can cause ata_pio_sector() to\nwrite outside the allocated buffer, overwriting random memory.\n\nWhile a ATA device is supposed to abort a ATA_NOP command, there does seem\nto be a bug either in libata-sff or QEMU, where either this status is not\nset, or the status is cleared before read by ata_sff_hsm_move().\nAnyway, that is most likely a separate bug.\n\nLooking at __atapi_pio_bytes(), it already has a safety check to ensure\nthat __atapi_pio_bytes() cannot write outside the allocated buffer.\n\nAdd a similar check to ata_pio_sector(), such that also ata_pio_sector()\ncannot write outside the allocated buffer."
