      "value": "It was discovered that dpkg does not properly sanitize directory permissions when extracting a control member into a temporary directory, which is\ndocumented as being a safe operation even on untrusted data, which may lead to leave temporary files behind on cleanup. Given automated and repeated execution of dpkg-deb commands on\nadversarial .deb packages or with well compressible files, placed\ninside a directory with permissions not allowing removal by a non-root\nuser, this can end up with a DoS scenario due to causing disk quota\nexhaustion or disk full conditions."
