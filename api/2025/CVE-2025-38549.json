      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nefivarfs: Fix memory leak of efivarfs_fs_info in fs_context error paths\n\nWhen processing mount options, efivarfs allocates efivarfs_fs_info (sfi)\nearly in fs_context initialization. However, sfi is associated with the\nsuperblock and typically freed when the superblock is destroyed. If the\nfs_context is released (final put) before fill_super is called—such as\non error paths or during reconfiguration—the sfi structure would leak,\nas ownership never transfers to the superblock.\n\nImplement the .free callback in efivarfs_context_ops to ensure any\nallocated sfi is properly freed if the fs_context is torn down before\nfill_super, preventing this memory leak."
