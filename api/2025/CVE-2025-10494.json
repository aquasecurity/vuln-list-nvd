      "value": "The Motors â€“ Car Dealership \u0026 Classified Listings Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation when deleting profile pictures in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.89. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."
