      "value": "diskover-web v2.3.0 Community Edition is vulnerable to multiple boolean-based blind SQL injection flaws in its Elasticsearch configuration form. Unsanitized user input in POST parameters such as ES_PASS, ES_MAXSIZE, ES_TRANSLOGSIZE, ES_TIMEOUT, ES_USER, ES_HOST, ES_PORT, ES_SCROLLSIZE, ES_CHUNKSIZE and others can be crafted to inject arbitrary SQLite expressions wrapped in JSON functions. By exploiting these injection points, an attacker can infer or extract sensitive information from the underlying database without authentication. This issue stems from improper input validation and parameterization in the application's JSON-based query construction."
