      "value": "Alpine iLX-507 Command Injection Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine iLX-507 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the Tidal music streaming application. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-26357."
