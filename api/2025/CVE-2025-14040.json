      "value": "The Automotive Car Dealership Business WordPress Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Call to Action' custom fields in all versions up to, and including, 13.4. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes in the 'action_text', 'action_button_text', 'action_link', and 'action_class' custom fields. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page."
