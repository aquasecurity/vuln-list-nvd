      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfs: Fix double put of request\n\nIf a netfs request finishes during the pause loop, it will have the ref\nthat belongs to the IN_PROGRESS flag removed at that point - however, if it\nthen goes to the final wait loop, that will *also* put the ref because it\nsees that the IN_PROGRESS flag is clear and incorrectly assumes that this\nhappened when it called the collector.\n\nIn fact, since IN_PROGRESS is clear, we shouldn't call the collector again\nsince it's done all the cleanup, such as calling -\u003eki_complete().\n\nFix this by making netfs_collect_in_app() just return, indicating that\nwe're done if IN_PROGRESS is removed."
