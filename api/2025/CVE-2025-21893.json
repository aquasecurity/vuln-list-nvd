      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkeys: Fix UAF in key_put()\n\nOnce a key's reference count has been reduced to 0, the garbage collector\nthread may destroy it at any time and so key_put() is not allowed to touch\nthe key after that point.  The most key_put() is normally allowed to do is\nto touch key_gc_work as that's a static global variable.\n\nHowever, in an effort to speed up the reclamation of quota, this is now\ndone in key_put() once the key's usage is reduced to 0 - but now the code\nis looking at the key after the deadline, which is forbidden.\n\nFix this by using a flag to indicate that a key can be gc'd now rather than\nlooking at the key's refcount in the garbage collector."
