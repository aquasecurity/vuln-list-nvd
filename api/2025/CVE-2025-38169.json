      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64/fpsimd: Avoid clobbering kernel FPSIMD state with SMSTOP\n\nOn system with SME, a thread's kernel FPSIMD state may be erroneously\nclobbered during a context switch immediately after that state is\nrestored. Systems without SME are unaffected.\n\nIf the CPU happens to be in streaming SVE mode before a context switch\nto a thread with kernel FPSIMD state, fpsimd_thread_switch() will\nrestore the kernel FPSIMD state using fpsimd_load_kernel_state() while\nthe CPU is still in streaming SVE mode. When fpsimd_thread_switch()\nsubsequently calls fpsimd_flush_cpu_state(), this will execute an\nSMSTOP, causing an exit from streaming SVE mode. The exit from\nstreaming SVE mode will cause the hardware to reset a number of\nFPSIMD/SVE/SME registers, clobbering the FPSIMD state.\n\nFix this by calling fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() before restoring the kernel\nFPSIMD state."
