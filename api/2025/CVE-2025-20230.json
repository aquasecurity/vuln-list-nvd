This is due to missing access control and incorrect ownership of the data in those KVStore collections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the affected versions, the `nobody` user owned the data in the KVStore collections. This meant that there was no specific owner assigned to the data in those collections."
