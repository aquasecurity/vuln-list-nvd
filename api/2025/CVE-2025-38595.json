      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen: fix UAF in dmabuf_exp_from_pages()\n\n[dma_buf_fd() fixes; no preferences regarding the tree it goes through -\nup to xen folks]\n\nAs soon as we'd inserted a file reference into descriptor table, another\nthread could close it.  That's fine for the case when all we are doing is\nreturning that descriptor to userland (it's a race, but it's a userland\nrace and there's nothing the kernel can do about it).  However, if we\nfollow fd_install() with any kind of access to objects that would be\ndestroyed on close (be it the struct file itself or anything destroyed\nby its -\u003erelease()), we have a UAF.\n\ndma_buf_fd() is a combination of reserving a descriptor and fd_install().\ngntdev dmabuf_exp_from_pages() calls it and then proceeds to access the\nobjects destroyed on close - starting with gntdev_dmabuf itself.\n\nFix that by doing reserving descriptor before anything else and do\nfd_install() only when everything had been set up."
