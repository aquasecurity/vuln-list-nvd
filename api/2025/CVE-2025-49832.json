In versions up to and including 18.26.2, between 20.00.0 and 20.15.0, 20.7-cert6, 21.00.0, 22.00.0 through 22.5.0, there is a remote DoS and possible RCE condition in `asterisk/res/res_stir_shaken /verification.c` that can be exploited when an attacker can set an arbitrary Identity header, or STIR/SHAKEN is enabled, with verification set in the SIP profile associated with the endpoint to be attacked. This is fixed in versions 18.26.3, 20.7-cert6, 20.15.1, 21.10.1 and 22.5.1."
