Attackers were able to confuse the parent process into leaking handles to unprivileged child processes leading to a sandbox escape. \nThe original vulnerability was being exploited in the wild. \n*This only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 136.0.4, Firefox ESR \u003c 128.8.1, and Firefox ESR \u003c 115.21.1."
