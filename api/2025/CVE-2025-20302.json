      "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure FMC Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to retrieve a generated report from a different domain.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to missing authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing a generated report file for a different domain that is managed on the same Cisco Secure FMC instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access a previously run report for a different domain, which could allow an attacker to read activity recorded in that domain."
