      "value": "The HT Contact Form Widget For Elementor Page Builder \u0026 Gutenberg Blocks \u0026 Form Builder. plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the temp_file_delete() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."
