      "value": "Nokia Single RAN baseband software versions earlier than 24R1-SR 2.1 MP contain a SOAP message input validation flaw, which in theory could potentially be used for causing resource exhaustion in the Single RAN baseband OAM service.\n\nNo practical exploit has been detected for this flaw. However, the issue has been corrected starting from release 24R1-SR 2.1 MP by adding sufficient input validation for received SOAP requests, effectively mitigating the reported issue."
