      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mdiobus: Fix potential out-of-bounds clause 45 read/write access\n\nWhen using publicly available tools like 'mdio-tools' to read/write data\nfrom/to network interface and its PHY via C45 (clause 45) mdiobus,\nthere is no verification of parameters passed to the ioctl and\nit accepts any mdio address.\nCurrently there is support for 32 addresses in kernel via PHY_MAX_ADDR define,\nbut it is possible to pass higher value than that via ioctl.\nWhile read/write operation should generally fail in this case,\nmdiobus provides stats array, where wrong address may allow out-of-bounds\nread/write.\n\nFix that by adding address verification before C45 read/write operation.\nWhile this excludes this access from any statistics, it improves security of\nread/write operation."
