      "value": "A vulnerability in the Virtual Keyboard Video Monitor (vKVM) connection handling of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials with privileges that allow for vKVM access on the affected device.\r\nNote: The affected vKVM client is also included in Cisco UCS Manager."
