      "value": "OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.12 and earlier, when the `AuthType` is set to anything but `Basic`, if the request contains an `Authorization: Basic ...` header, the password is not checked. This results in authentication bypass. Any configuration that allows an `AuthType` that is not `Basic` is affected. Version 2.4.13 fixes the issue."
