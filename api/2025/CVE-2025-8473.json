This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Alpine iLX-507 devices. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the UPDM_wstpCBCUpdStart function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-26317."
