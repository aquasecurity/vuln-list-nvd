      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Increase block_sequence array size\n\n[Why]\nIt's possible to generate more than 50 steps in hwss_build_fast_sequence,\nfor example with a 6-pipe asic where all pipes are in one MPC chain. This\noverflows the block_sequence buffer and corrupts block_sequence_steps,\ncausing a crash.\n\n[How]\nExpand block_sequence to 100 items. A naive upper bound on the possible\nnumber of steps for a 6-pipe asic, ignoring the potential for steps to be\nmutually exclusive, is 91 with current code, therefore 100 is sufficient."
