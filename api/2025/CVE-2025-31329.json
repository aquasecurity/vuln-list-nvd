      "value": "SAP NetWeaver is vulnerable to an Information Disclosure vulnerability caused by the injection of malicious instructions into user configuration settings. An attacker with administrative privileges can craft these instructions so that when accessed by the victim, sensitive information such as user credentials is exposed. These credentials may then be used to gain unauthorized access to local or adjacent systems. This results in high impact to Confidentiality, with no significant effect on Integrity or Availability."
