An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code into specific data fields in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r    \r\n\r  {{value}} [\"%7b%7bvalue%7d%7d\"])}]]"
