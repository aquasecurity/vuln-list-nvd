      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfs/ntfs3: cancle set bad inode after removing name fails\n\nThe reproducer uses a file0 on a ntfs3 file system with a corrupted i_link.\nWhen renaming, the file0's inode is marked as a bad inode because the file\nname cannot be deleted.\n\nThe underlying bug is that make_bad_inode() is called on a live inode.\nIn some cases it's \"icache lookup finds a normal inode, d_splice_alias()\nis called to attach it to dentry, while another thread decides to call\nmake_bad_inode() on it - that would evict it from icache, but we'd already\nfound it there earlier\".\nIn some it's outright \"we have an inode attached to dentry - that's how we\ngot it in the first place; let's call make_bad_inode() on it just for shits\nand giggles\"."
