An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the interface and sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands as the root\u0026nbsp;user on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need\u0026nbsp;Administrator-level credentials."
